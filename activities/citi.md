# Denison University IRB – CITI Course

Instructions for researchers needing a human-subjects research course certification on ethical principles and practices (CITI Program SBE Modules; a.k.a. “IRB Course,” as of Oct 21, 2018).

1. In your Internet browser, navigate to [http://citiprogram.org](http://citiprogram.org), and then Click the Log-In button in the upper right.
2. Choose 'REGISTER.' Do __NOT__ choose 'log in through my institution'
3. Under 'Select your Organization Affiliation', type into the box 'Deni ...' until Denison University comes up as an option from the resulting list, then choose it.
4. Check the Agree box.
5. Check the Affirm box (for Denison, again).
6. Continue this process to create your own CITI Program user name and password. (Denison has an institutional subscription with CITI, but each user must follow steps here to create their own log in and identification info in  order to access Denison’s institutional course modules.)
7. Continue through all steps as shown on the website (there are seven steps).
8. For Step 5, choose 'No' for all the responses on that screen.
9. Once you have completed your own registration process, you can then log in and see/access the SBE Modules to complete the 'course' that is required for Denison human subjects researchers. It should display as something like 'Research Community Members (Faculty, Staff, Students, College Administrators, IRB Members)'

Completing the required CITI SBE Modules takes (~3 hours) depending on knowledge and quiz-completion. A quiz follows each Module. There are eight required modules, and several optional ones relevant to different research areas/questions, populations, and/or methodologies.

Once you have completed the required Modules, see the 'Post-Course Completion Options.' Access your Completion Records, and then scroll down the page headed View-Print-Share Completion Record, scrolling until you see under Completion Certificates: 'To view or print the Completion Certificate for this course, click on the link below.'

Please __DO NOT__ email a link from this page. Instead, from that page, you should be able to open a new browser window with that link, then see your certificate, and
download/save it as a pdf. Download this file, and upload it to the Notebowl assignment called "CITI course certificate -- proof of completion"
