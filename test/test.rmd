## Data and Code Ledger for DA 101

This is an R Markdown document. Please fill in all example text with your own words and definitions. For each function in the your ledger, you should show your code. If you need extra code to do some data wrangling or bring in a new library, please hide it from the rendered html. Each term should have: 
 (1) what package does it come from?
 (2) general definition - what does the function do and for what kind of tasks/situations would you use it?
 (3) worked example, using your own data set, or one of the example data sets from an R package
 (4) text below the example that explains specifically, what the code accomplished. In other words, what was the input and the output? What can you do now that you have run the example that you couldn't before?
 
### Load useful datasets

```{r setup2, include=FALSE}
# add flights data to environment
library(nycflights13)
# add diamonds and mpg data to environment
library(tidyverse)

flights <- flights
diamonds <- diamonds
mpg <- mpg

# HINT: check out other data sets in ggplot2 such as economics, midwest, seals, and faithfuld. They might be useful for the tasks below.

```

### Data Wrangling

```{r, histogram, echo=TRUE}

# a comment

ggplot(flights) + geom_histogram(aes(x=dep_delay), bins=150) + labs(title="Histogram of Departure Delays") 
```
